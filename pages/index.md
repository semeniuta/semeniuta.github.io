## About

Hi, my name is **Oleksandr Semeniuta**. I am a researcher in *automation*  focusing on applications of computer vision and data science in industrial robotic systems. Currently I am a PhD research fellow at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/) while pursuing my doctoral degree at [Chalmers University of Technology](http://www.chalmers.se/).

My research interests include, but not limited to, geometric computer vision, image segmentation, machine learning, data science, Bayesian methods, cyber-physical systems, networked control systems, distributed computing architecture, and cloud robotics and automation.

I enjoy developing solutions based on open source technologies, and look for the ways of more smooth transition from ad-hoc hacking and tinkering to building well-structured computing and control systems.
